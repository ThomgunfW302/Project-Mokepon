Mokepon
This is an experimental project I created to practice my knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It is a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game inspired by Pokémon.

INSTALATION
This project only need to download the files and run the HTML one. The images are already linked with the files.

HOW TO USE
On the interface, you must select your character, then you are gonna pass to the gameplay. You are gonna have 3 attacks to select: 
- Water
- Fire
- Ground

Your character and your enemy one have 3 lives.
You and your enemy are gonna select l attack, if your attack beats your enemy one, the enemy character are gonna lose 1 live. 
The character that remains standing until the end wins.

HOW IT WORKS
The game depends in the Rock-Paper-Scissors's system and Random Number Generation:
- Rock-Paper-Scissors's System:
  It is simple, Water beats Fire, Fire beats Ground and Ground beats Water.

- Random Number Generation:
  When you pick an attack, the code is gonna generate an number between 1 - 3, each number represents an attack.
  Once the number is generated, the enemy’s attack is selected.
  Then, the game compares your attack with the enemy’s attack using the Rock–Paper–Scissors system, determines the winner, and subtracts one life from the losing character.
